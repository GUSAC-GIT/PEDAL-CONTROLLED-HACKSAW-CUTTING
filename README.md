## Description

Hacksaw machine that is operated manually by pedal cycling to eases human labor in cutting vegetables, wood, plastic and other basic light materials by increasing mechanical advantage and reducing the requisite effort. 
Here, the hacksaw machine performs in cutting objects with its sharp and replaceable hacksaw blade. With strong crankshaft mechanism and revolving chain and sprocket operation, this system is made more durable and efficient. A sitting place is affiliated to ensure comfort and longevity of operation without exhaust. In this device, the frame is designed to grab the wood piece properly while vibrating. 
Moreover, the tray in the frame collects sawdust and wheels make the device locomotive. 
Besides, device parts are made individually that can be separated while necessary so that it becomes easily portable. 
Converting the rotating cycling force to the reciprocal sliding blade force is the fundamental principle behind the proposed system. The system performance is measured and results are found satisfactory for real-time application.
